GarudaNvim is more than just another Neovim setup – it’s a finely tuned machine built for those who want to code, not configure. From productivity-boosting keymaps to eye-pleasing themes, GarudaNvim takes Neovim to new heights. Dive in to see what makes it tick:

---

## Effortless Installation
- **Automatic Setup, Minimal Hassle:** Our installer handles everything from OS detection to plugin setup, leaving you more time to focus on your code and less time wondering why things don’t work.
- **Cross-Platform Magic:** Whether you’re on macOS or Linux, GarudaNvim's installer is as compatible as the most versatile coder. One run, and it’s all set up – no more wrestling with dependencies.

## Productivity Powerhouse
- **Shortcut Wizardry:** With GarudaNvim’s custom keymaps, you’ll forget what “slow” feels like. Jump between files, split windows, resize buffers – it’s all a keystroke away. Less typing, more coding.
- **Which-Key Guidance:** With Which-Key as your guide, every possible keybinding is right at your fingertips. No more <leader> + ??? guessing games – just press, discover, and power up.
  
## Enhanced Navigation
- **Telescope for Search-Anything:** Need to find a file, buffer, or command? Telescope integration lets you glide through your project faster than a Ctrl+F on steroids. Say goodbye to scrolling aimlessly.
- **NvimTree for File Management:** A built-in, intuitive file explorer keeps all your files accessible with a simple shortcut. Navigate like a pro without ever leaving Neovim’s window.

## Customizable UI Elements
- **Polished Status and Tab Lines:** With **Lualine** for the statusline and **Barbar** for the tabline, you get a sleek, customizable interface that keeps tabs on your workflow without becoming a cluttered mess.
- **Eye-Friendly Highlights:** Each highlight color and cursorline has been meticulously chosen to ensure comfort, visibility, and minimal eye strain – because staring at code all day is already hard enough.

## Multiple Themes Built In
- **Color Schemes for Every Mood:** With options like **Tokyo Night**, **Nordic**, **Dracula**, **Catppuccin**, and more, you can match your Neovim vibes with your monitor brightness (or your mood, no judgment here).
- **Light and Dark Mode Toggle:** A single command flips the theme, so you can go from night owl to daylight coder without skipping a beat.

## Seamless Plugin Management
- **Lazy for Effortless Plugin Control:** Why “install manually” when you can “install lazily”? With the **Lazy** plugin manager, adding, updating, or removing plugins is as effortless as a lazy Sunday.
- **Curated Essentials:** Hand-picked plugins for maximum productivity – from **Onedarkpro** for a pleasing default theme to **Telescope** for instant file searching. Only the best make the cut.

## Minimal Yet Expandable
- **Core Setup, Endless Potential:** GarudaNvim starts minimal so you can build up as needed. Want a bare-bones environment? Done. Want to add your own collection of plugins and tweak everything? Go wild.
- **Easy Customization:** Adjust options, add new plugins, or play around with settings without having to unearth cryptic files. The setup is designed to be as flexible as a Neovim enthusiast’s ideal config.

## Detailed Documentation
- **Knowledge At Your Fingertips:** Whether you’re a Neovim newbie or a seasoned coder, the GarudaNvim Docs cover everything you need to know, from installation to mastering every shortcut. No need to trawl forums for answers.
- **Example-Rich Explanations:** Real examples, quick tips, and straightforward instructions ensure that you spend more time coding and less time deciphering docs.

## Updates and Feedback
- **Constant Updates and Improvements:** GarudaNvim is a passion project by Priyanshu Ranjan, supported by a growing community of Neovim enthusiasts. Expect regular improvements, fresh features, and feedback-driven updates.
- **Built by Coders, for Coders:** GarudaNvim grows with the feedback of real-world usage, so everything here is designed with developers' needs in mind.

Take GarudaNvim for a spin, and you’ll see – it’s the Neovim setup you didn’t know you needed. It’s efficient, it’s powerful, and yes, it’s a bit sarcastic. But when you’re coding at warp speed, you’ll get it.
