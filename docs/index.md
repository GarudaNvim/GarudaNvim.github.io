## **Introduction**

Reimagining how you code!

**GarudaNvim** ‚Äì the Neovim configuration you didn‚Äôt know you needed, but now you‚Äôll wonder how you ever lived without it. Say goodbye to excessive mouse-clicking and embrace the Zen of keyboard-powered coding.

In the Hindu mythology, Garuda is more than just a mythical creature ‚Äî it‚Äôs a symbol of speed, precision, and freedom. Often depicted as a powerful eagle soaring high above, Garuda is known for its ability to cover vast distances swiftly, with unwavering focus.

Inspired by the legendary speed, agility and swiftness of Garuda (and, let‚Äôs face it, our collective disdain for reaching for the mouse every five seconds), the configuration helps you code faster and navigate seamlessly. Fly through the code like Garuda through the skies!

Here's what we have got for you!

## **Why GarudaNvim?** 

It‚Äôs simple: speed, agility, and an obsession with keyboard shortcuts.

- **Keyboard-Centric**: Almost everything can be done from the keyboard (why use a mouse to decrease productivity), for that true coder-on-the-go experience.
- **Powerful Keymaps**: We believe that every key has a purpose (like your mistakes‚Ä¶ just kidding!). A thoughtfully crafted keymap system that enhances your productivity.
- **Cross-Platform**: Optimized for macOS and Linux. Sorry Windows fans, maybe someday. üòâ

With GarudaNvim, get ready to code faster, customize deeper, and maybe even impress your colleagues(and partner!) with how rarely you reach for the mouse.

Big thanks to [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) for making terminal-based coding awesome (and for the endless possibilities of `:q!`). And to the creators of all the plugins we rely on ‚Äì we owe you a whole lot of coffees and an embarrassing number of pull requests.

## **Last Words...**

Happy Coding with GarudaNvim üíª </br>
Welcome to the Cult (oh sorry, I meant Club)

P.S. ‚Äì This project is the brainchild of **Priyanshu Ranjan**, a final-year student at **IIT Kharagpur**, and he‚Äôs poured his heart (and far too many late-night and exam hours) into it.
