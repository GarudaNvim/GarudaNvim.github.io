</div>

Welcome to the GarudaNvim community! We’re here to build, learn, and support each other in the pursuit of better Neovim experiences. By participating, you agree to abide by the following guidelines. Think of this as a mutual pact for keeping our space welcoming, inclusive, and just a bit easier to navigate—like a well-written config file.

## **<span class="sh-font tsh-color">Be Respectful</span>**  
Treat everyone here with respect. Behind every code snippet is a real person with their own journey—kindness goes a long way.

## **<span class="sh-font tsh-color">Constructive Feedback Only</span>**  
If you spot an improvement, share it kindly. “Here’s a tweak that could make this faster” > “This is awful.” Positive language helps us all grow.

## **<span class="sh-font tsh-color">Help Beginners, Patiently</span>**  
Not everyone is a Neovim wizard (yet). Remember when you learned to exit Vim for the first time? Exactly. Patience is key.

## **<span class="sh-font tsh-color">Stay on Topic, but Keep it Light</span>**  
This community is about GarudaNvim and its ecosystem. Off-topic discussions belong elsewhere. A little humor is welcome, but let’s avoid unrelated tangents.

## **<span class="sh-font tsh-color">Healthy Debates, No Flame Wars</span>**  
Opinions vary, and that’s okay. Debate ideas, not people. A healthy discussion is great; a heated argument? Not so much.

## **<span class="sh-font tsh-color">Keep the Community Organized</span>**  
Use appropriate channels for bug reports, discussions, and feedback. It helps everyone find what they need faster.

## **<span class="sh-font tsh-color">Avoid Self-Promotion</span>**  
Have something cool to share? Awesome. But if it feels like an ad or an infomercial, maybe think twice. We’re here for code, not commercials.

## **<span class="sh-font tsh-color">Celebrate All Wins</span>**  
Managed to configure a plugin after hours of tweaking? Share it! Big or small, every win is worth celebrating in coding.

## **<span class="sh-font tsh-color">Respect Privacy</span>**  
Avoid sending unsolicited messages or prying into private information. Everyone deserves their space online, too.

## **<span class="sh-font tsh-color">English, Please</span>**  
Code is a universal language, but discussion is not. Stick to English so that everyone can follow along.

## **<span class="sh-font tsh-color">Report Issues Responsibly</span>**  
If you notice behavior that doesn’t align with these guidelines, let us know. We’re here to keep this community a safe space.

## **<span class="sh-font tsh-color">Remember: Contributions are Voluntary</span>**  
Every pull request, issue resolved, and answer shared is voluntary. Respect everyone’s time and efforts, whether you agree with them or not.
